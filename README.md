# go-techbier-2024

This is the repository for ipt's **TechBier Go**, an event to get an introduction to Golang's many features.

This event revolves around a small TUI app, based on the amazing [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/), built using the [bubbletea framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea). Our app includes usages of the following Go features:

- structs and implementing interfaces
- use of standard library, with `net/http` and `encoding/json`
- importing a new package
- goroutines and channels
- and Golang's new generics!
